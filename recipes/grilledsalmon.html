        <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
            <ul>
                <li>2 sticks of fresh lemongrass<em>, slightly bashed to release flavours</em></li>
                <li>1 bunch of fresh coriander (30g)<em>, picked and roughly chopped</em></li>
                <li>5cm piece of fresh ginger<em>, peeled and grated</em></li>
                <li>4 cloves of garlic<em>, grated</em></li>
                <li>1/2 small bottle of low-salt, dark soy sauce</li>
                <li>1 large salmon fillet, (about 1kg)</li>
                <li>4 tbsp runny honey</li>
                <li>2 red chillies<em>, de-seeded and sliced</em></li>
                <li> 4 spring onions<em>, finely sliced</em></li>
                <li>2 limes<em>, halved</em></li>

            </ul>
        <p><h2>Instructions</h2></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Bash up your lemongrass. Pick the coriander leaves and finely slice the stalks. Peel and finely grate the ginger and garlic.</li>
                <li>Mix the lemongrass, coriander stalks, ginger and garlic with the soy sauce, then rub all over the salmon fillet. Leave it to marinate for an hour or so, either in a plastic bag or on a tray covered with clingfilm.</li>
                <li>Preheat your grill to its highest setting. When you're ready to cook the salmon, remove it from the marinade, brush with the honey and grill for 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>De-seed the chillies and finely slice with the spring onions.</li>
                <li>Fork up the cooked salmon a little so everyone can see the lovely, dark, sticky outside and the juicy, pink fish underneath.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle the chillies and spring onions over the salmon with the reserved coriander leaves. Squeeze over the lime.</li>
                <li>Serve with fluffy white rice, and some steamed greens tossed in sesame oil for that perfect touch.</li>
            </ol>

Recipe website project
At the end of this project I will aim to have created a working HTML recipe website, demonstrating the following skills:
    - core HTML site structure inc; doctype, title, head & body 
    - use of ordered, and unordered, lists functions
    - adding images
    - creating absolute and relative links
    - creating different pages
    - show good file structure and organisation
    - display a strong use and understanding of the git 'add', 'commit', and 'push'/'push origin main'
